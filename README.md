# 🌌 CosmoDynamics – Simulating the Universe Before the Big Bang

## 📖 Overview
**CosmoDynamics** is a Python-based cosmological simulation project inspired by  
*“Prima del Big Bang”* by **Gian Francesco Giudice**.

The goal is to translate advanced concepts of modern cosmology into **numerical, visual, and interactive models**, suitable for education, research prototyping, and data science portfolios.

## 🧠 Physical Models Implemented

The simulations focus on the **scale factor** \( a(t) \), central to FLRW cosmology.

### 1️⃣ Standard Big Bang (ΛCDM-like)
- Classical expanding universe
- Power-law growth of the scale factor
- Represents the standard cosmological paradigm

### 2️⃣ Inflationary Universe
- Early exponential expansion
- Controlled by the Hubble-like parameter `H`
- Addresses horizon and flatness problems

### 3️⃣ Big Bounce Cosmology
- No initial singularity
- Contraction phase followed by expansion
- Inspired by quantum gravity scenarios

## 🧮 Mathematical Roadmap

The notebook integrates:
- Numerical computation with `NumPy`
- Time evolution of cosmological quantities
- Conceptual links to:
  - Friedmann equations
  - Inflationary dynamics
  - Non-singular cosmologies
